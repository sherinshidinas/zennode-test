Steps of the Programs:
-) Define Product Prices, Discount Rules, and Fees:
     We start by defining the prices of each product, discount rules, and fees such as the gift wrap fee and shipping fee per 
     package.
-) Calculate Discount:
      We define a function calculateDiscount to calculate the discount amount based on the items in the cart and the discount 
      rules.
-) Calculate Shipping Fee:
      We define a function calculateShippingFee to calculate the shipping fee based on the number of packages required for the 
      items in the cart.
-) Handle Order:
   The handleOrder function is the entry point of our program.
      It prompts the user for the quantity of each product and whether they want to wrap it as a gift.
      It calculates the subtotal, discount, shipping fee, and total amount.
      It displays the item details, discount applied, discount amount, shipping fee, and total.
-) Input Quantity and Gift Wrapping:
   When you run the program, it prompts you to enter the quantity of each product and whether you want to wrap it as a gift.
   You enter the quantity of each product and choose whether to wrap it as a gift by typing "yes" or "no" in the command line.
-) View Item Details:
   After entering the quantity and gift wrapping choices, the program displays the details of each item, including quantity, 
   price per unit, and total amount.
-) View Discount Applied:
   The program calculates the discount based on the rules defined and displays the discount applied along with the discount 
   amount.
-) View Shipping Fee:
   It calculates the shipping fee based on the total quantity of items and displays the shipping fee.

-) View Total Amount:
   Finally, the program calculates the total amount, considering the subtotal, discount, and shipping fee, and displays the 
   total amount to be paid.
